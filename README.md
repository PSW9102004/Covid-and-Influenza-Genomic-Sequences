## üìå Project Overview

In this project, machine learning techniques are applied to classify genomic sequences of influenza and COVID-19. The main focus is on extracting meaningful features from the genomic data and using classifiers like **Linear SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression** to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing these viruses.
